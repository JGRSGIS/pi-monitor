# Pi Monitor - Production Requirements
# =====================================
#
# This project intentionally uses ZERO external dependencies.
# All functionality is implemented using Python 3.7+ standard library only.
#
# Standard library modules used:
# - json          (JSON encoding/decoding)

# - threading     (Multi-threading support)
# - urllib        (URL/HTTP operations)
#
# Python Version Requirement:
# - Minimum: Python 3.7 (for f-strings, http.server improvements)

#
# To verify your Python version:
#   python3 --version
